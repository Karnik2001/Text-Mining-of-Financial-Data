# Text-Mining-of-Financial-Data

## Overview

This project performs text analysis and sentiment mining on financial data to extract valuable insights from unstructured text. The goal is to analyze the frequency of words and identify the sentiment (positive/negative) in financial reports or articles. The project uses R and various packages to preprocess, analyze, and visualize the data.

## Key Steps

- Data Import & Preprocessing:

- Import financial data from a CSV file.

- Tokenize text into individual words.

- Remove common stop words to focus on meaningful terms.

Word Frequency Analysis:

- Count the frequency of each word to identify the most common terms.

Sentiment Analysis:

- Use the Bing Sentiment Lexicon to categorize words as positive or negative.

Visualization:

- Create a word cloud to visually represent the most frequent words and sentiments.

Technologies Used

- R programming (tidyverse, tidytext, dplyr, wordcloud)

Sentiment analysis with the Bing lexicon

- Data visualization using wordcloud and RColorBrewer

## Output

- A word cloud visualization showing the most frequent words.

- Sentiment analysis results categorizing words as positive or negative.
